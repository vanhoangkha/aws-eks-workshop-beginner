Most of the labs in this workshop use a common sample application to provide actual container components that we can work on during the exercises. The sample application models a simple web store application, where customers can browse a catalog, add items to their cart and complete an order through the checkout process.

The application has several components and dependencies:

| Component     | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UI**            | Provides the front end user interface and aggregates API calls to the various other services. |
| **Catalog**       | API for product listings and details                                                          |
| **Cart**          | API for customer shopping carts                                                               |
| **Checkout**      | API to orchestrate the checkout process                                                       |
| **Orders**        | API to receive and process customer orders                                                    |
| **Static assets** | Serves static assets like images related to the product catalog                               |

Initially we'll deploy the application in a manner that is self-contained in the Amazon EKS cluster, without using any AWS services like load balancers or a managed database. Over the course of the labs we'll leverage different features of EKS to take advantage of broader AWS services and features for our retail store.

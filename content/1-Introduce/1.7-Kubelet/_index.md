In this section we will take a look at kubelet.

#### Kubelet is the sole point of contact for the kubernetes cluster
- The **`kubelet`** will create the pods on the nodes, the scheduler only decides which pods goes where.

### Install kubelet
- Kubeadm does not deploy kubelet by default. You must manually download and install it.
- Download the kubelet binary from the kubernetes release pages [kubelet](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.13.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubelet). For example: To download kubelet v1.13.0, Run the below command.
```
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.13.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubelet
```
- Extract it
- Run it as a service

### View kubelet options
- You can also see the running process and affective options by listing the process on worker node and searching for kubelet.
``` 
$ ps -aux |grep kubelet
```

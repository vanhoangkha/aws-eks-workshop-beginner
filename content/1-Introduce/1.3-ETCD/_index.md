### What is a ETCD?
- ETCD is a distributed reliable key-value store that is simple, secure & Fast.

### What is a Key-Value Store
- Traditionally, databases have been in tabular format, you must have heard about SQL or Relational databases. They store data in rows and columns

- A Key-Value Store stores information in a Key and Value format.

### Install ETCD
- It's easy to install and get started with **`ETCD`**.
- Download the relevant binary for your operating system from github releases page (https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases)

For Example: To download ETCD v3.5.6, run the below curl command

```
$ curl -LO https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/download/v3.5.6/etcd-v3.5.6-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
- Extract it.
```
$ tar xvzf etcd-v3.5.6-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
- Run the ETCD Service
```
$ ./etcd
```
- When you start **`ETCD`** it will by default listen on port **`2379`**
- The default client that comes with **`ETCD`** is the [**`etcdctl`**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/etcdctl) client. You can use it to store and retrieve key-value pairs.
```
Syntax: To Store a Key-Value pair
$ ./etcdctl put key1 value1
```
```
Syntax: To retrieve the stored data
$ ./etcdctl get key1
```
```
Syntax: To view more commands. Run etcdctl without any arguments
$ ./etcdctl
```

### ETCD Datastore
- The ETCD Datastore stores information regarding the cluster such as **`Nodes`**, **`PODS`**, **`Configs`**, **`Secrets`**, **`Accounts`**, **`Roles`**, **`Bindings`** and **`Others`**.
- Every information you see when you run the **`kubectl get`** command is from the **`ETCD Server`**.

### Setup - Manual
- If you setup your cluster from scratch then you deploy **`ETCD`** by downloading ETCD Binaries yourself
- Installing Binaries and Configuring ETCD as a service in your master node yourself.
```
$ wget -q --https-only "https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/download/v3.3.11/etcd-v3.3.11-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
```
  
### Setup - Kubeadm
- If you setup your cluster using **`kubeadm`** then kubeadm will deploy etcd server for you as a pod in **`kube-system`** namespace.
```
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

### Explore ETCD
- To list all keys stored by kubernetes, run the below command
```
$ kubectl exec etcd-master -n kube-system -- sh -c "ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt get / --prefix --keys-only"
```
- Kubernetes Stores data in a specific directory structure, the root directory is the **`registry`** and under that you have various kubernetes constructs such as **`minions`**, **`nodes`**, **`pods`**, **`replicasets`**, **`deployments`**, **`roles`**, **`secrets`** and **`Others`**.

### ETCD in HA Environment
- In a high availability environment, you will have multiple master nodes in your cluster that will have multiple ETCD Instances spread across the master nodes.
- Make sure etcd instances know each other by setting the right parameter in the **`etcd.service`** configuration. The **`--initial-cluster`** option where you need to specify the different instances of the etcd service.

In this section, we will take a look at kube-scheduler.

#### kube-scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods on nodes.  
- The kube-scheduler is only responsible for deciding which pod goes on which node. It doesn't actually place the pod on the nodes, that's the job of the **`kubelet`**.

### Why do you need a Scheduler?

- **kube-scheduler** plays an important role in resource management and ensuring that pods are allocated efficiently across nodes.
